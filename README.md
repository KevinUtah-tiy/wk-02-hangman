Synopsis

If you aren't familiar with the game of [Hangman] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_ game, don't worry! It's very simple. When you play with two people one picks a word and then the other tries to guess it by making repeated guesses to letters in the word. If the letter is in the word then the player who picked a word reveals all the places where that letter is in the final word. If the letter is not in the word then a body part is added to the hangman.



Code Example

The person playing this game should be able to get a randomly selected word from a given array (in JavaScript); have underscores to tell how many letters were generated; allow guesses and giving the number of guesses remaining.



Motivation

To guess a word, given the number of letters, before the hangman does his business.  There will be six chances to guess that word.



Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.


API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.



Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
